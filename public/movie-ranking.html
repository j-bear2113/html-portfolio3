<h1>The Best Horror Movies According to Joel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 horror movies of the year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<p>The less you know going in, the better. Going in to the movie I was not expecting it to play out the way it did. A fun and creepy adventure!</p>
<h3>The Taking of Deborah Logan</h3>
<p>I watched this movie home alone, and I was legit creeped out and scared afterward. </p>
<h3>Oddity</h3>
<p>A suspenseful slow burn that is guranteed to make you feel uncomfortable at least a few time while viewing.</p>
